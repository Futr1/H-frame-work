Nowadays, LLMs still face hallucinations problem. To this problem, Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) transfers
non-parametric knowledge to LLMs and has been proven to be an effective means to enhance the accuracy of model
answers. Traditional RAG is effective to support LLMs to find the most relevant surface answer from the vector
library, but often does not work well on deeper reasons related to the input. This paper defines the concept of 
**cued memory**, which removes text with high confidence (even if it is highly relevant) after finding the answer related to the
LLMs input. This helps the LLMs to explore the underlying relevant knowledge that match the input. In this paper,
through the exploration of cued memory, we also propose a new **H-framework** RAG: obtain contextual relationships
in the form of a global dependency encoder, use an information filter to delete the direct information that the model
has already obtained and retain the underlying knowledge that has not been learned, and obtain out into cued memory.
Then the cued memory is sent to the sequential dependency encoder, which can achieve dynamic truncation and
dynamic output of multiple high-quality memories. To the end, by creating an infinite memory pool, all the enhanced
text can be fed back to the memory pool, so as to improves the efficiency of memory pool. Our method out performs
on the public dialogue dataset DailyDialog and the translation dataset JRC-Acquis as well as the locally built private
question-answering dataset. In particular, in the dialogue task, our H framework achieved the best B-1/2 result, and
LLMs with cue memory also achieved **SOTA results** in the noise test. The project code and data related to this article
are publicly published at: https://github.com/Futr1/H-frame-work

### Environment
PyTorch version >= 1.10.0
Python version >= 3.8
For training new models, we did  training on 2*A100+2*A6000.

```bash
conda create -n cue memory  python=3.10.0
conda activate cue memory
bash env.sh
```

### Cue memory
This repository contains the source code for this paper.The core of this paper is **cue memory**, which is used to extract information from the context that is not directly related but crucial. It primarily involves removing information already mastered by the model and retaining indirectly relevant knowledge. This project will provide a detailed explanation of its implementation steps, using a translation task as an example.

The script uses Fairseq and other tools to complete data preparation, model training, and evaluation for machine translation (MT) tasks. To proceed, navigate to the directory /mnt/7t/fys/fu_dir/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix-master/selfmemory/SelfMemory/fairseq-main/fairseq-main/examples/discriminative_reranking_nmt. Below is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the script:


#### 1.Initial Definition

```
**SOURCE_FILE**: Source language text file (`source.txt`)  
**TARGET_FILE**: Target language text file (`test.txt`)  
**HYPO_FILE**: File storing model-generated hypotheses (`output.txt`)  
**XLMR_DIR**: Directory path containing the SentencePiece model and other resources  
**OUTPUT_DIR**: Directory to save processed output files and training results  
**SPLIT**: Specifies the dataset split to process (`train`, `test`, `valid`)  
**N**: Number of beam search hypotheses to generate, which must match the multiple of the target language text and hypothesis files  
**NUM_SHARDS**: Number of data shards for parallel processing  
**METRIC**: Evaluation metric, default is set to `"bleu"`
```

#### 2. Data preparation
The data will be saved in /mnt/7t/fys/fu_dir/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix-master/selfmemory/SelfMemory/fairseq-main/fairseq-main/examples/discriminative_reranking_nmt/out2
Preprocess the data for each split by running the scripts/prep_data.py script. This script receives the source, target, and hypothesis files and generates the inputs required for training and evaluation.
```
python scripts/prep_data.py \
    --input-source ${SOURCE_FILE} \
    --input-target ${TARGET_FILE} \
    --input-hypo ${HYPO_FILE} \
    --output-dir ${OUTPUT_DIR} \
    --split $SPLIT \
    --beam $N \
    --sentencepiece-model ${XLMR_DIR}/sentencepiece.bpe.model \
    --num-shards ${NUM_SHARDS}
```
Run for each data split (train, test, valid) separately. That is, run three times, the training, validation and test data sets in the out2/blue/splite{N} path

#### 3.  Data preprocessing
Convert the data to Fairseq's binary format for fast loading, using the dict.txt file as a shared dictionary for both the source and target languages.
```
for suffix in src tgt ; do
    fairseq-preprocess --only-source \
        --trainpref ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split1/input_${suffix}/train.bpe \
        --validpref ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split1/input_${suffix}/valid.bpe \
        --destdir ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split1/input_${suffix} \
        --workers 60 \
        --srcdict ${XLMR_DIR}/dict.txt
```

Create a symbolic link for the shard data, that is, link your creation folder to the program's folder, so you don't have to modify the path. For other shards (starting from split2), create a symbolic link pointing to the split1 verification file to save space and time:
```
for i in `seq 2 ${NUM_SHARDS}`; do
    for suffix in src tgt ; do
        fairseq-preprocess --only-source \
            --trainpref ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split${i}/input_${suffix}/train.bpe \
            --destdir ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split${i}/input_${suffix} \
            --workers 60 \
            --srcdict ${XLMR_DIR}/dict.txt

        ln -s ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split1/input_${suffix}/valid* ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split${i}/input_${suffix}/.
    done

    ln -s ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split1/$METRIC/valid* ${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split${i}/$METRIC/.
done
```

#### 4. Training the model using Fairseq
The fairseq-hydra-train command is used to start model training and configure distributed training on multiple GPUs
This configuration points to the model data directory, pre-trained model files, and other distributed training options. The training data is saved in /mnt/7t/fys/fu_dir/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix-master/selfmemory/SelfMemory/fairseq-main/fairseq-main/examples/discriminative_reranking_nmt/multirun/2024-11-10, 2024-11-10 is your running time, and it will be saved according to the date
```
fairseq-hydra-train -m \
    --config-dir config/ --config-name deen \
    task.data=${OUTPUT_DIR}/$METRIC/split1/ \
    task.num_data_splits=${NUM_SHARDS} \
    model.pretrained_model=${XLMR_DIR}/model.pt \
    common.user_dir=${FAIRSEQ_ROOT}/examples/discriminative_reranking_nmt \
    checkpoint.save_dir=${EXP_DIR} \
    distributed_training.distributed_world_size=4
```
